# CSCI 323 - Robotics
**Institution:** Minot State University  
**Term:** Spring 2010  

- Introduction to robotics emphasis is on the computer design, programming of autonomous robot systems, basic dynamics and control of motion, sensors, and artificial intelligence techniques for robot applications in the real world.  Individual and group projects analyze robot control problems, designing hardware, and software solutions.  Students write basic control programs for different robot platforms and apply state-of-art artificial intelligence techniques to the control of robotic mechanisms.
