# Assignment 11:
- Write a program to calculate the monthly payment given three values associated with
a mortgage. The interest paid each month is the monthly rate of interest (annual
Rate of Interest / 12) applied to the balance at the beginning of the month. Each month the
reduction of principal equals the monthly payment minus the interest paid. At any time,
the balance of the mortgage is the amount still owed; that is, the amount required to pay off
the mortgage. The end of month balance is calculated as [beginning of month balance] -
[reduction of principal].
