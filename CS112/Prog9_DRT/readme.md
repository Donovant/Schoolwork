# Assignment 9:
- Write a program in which the user enters a number into a masked text
box and then clicks on the appropriate button to have either one of three pieces of humor
or one of three insults displayed in a text box below the buttons. (Note: Some possible bits of
humor are "I can resist everything except temptation," "I just heard from Bill Bailey. He's
not coming home," and "Adding people to a late software project makes it later." Some possible
insults are "How much would you charge to haunt a house 1" "I'll bet you have no more
friends than an alarm clock," and "When your IQ rises to 30, sell.")
