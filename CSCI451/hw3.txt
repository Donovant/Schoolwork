HW-3	CS451	20 points	Due: Friday September 27

Write a C/C++ program that uses the PTHREAD library to create 2 threads.
The program must to the following:

* MAIN will open a file (hw4.out) for writing, then call thread #1 and 
  thread #2. MAIN will also close the file when thread #1 and thread 
  #2 are finished.

* THREAD #1 will open a file (hw4-1.in) for reading, will read 1 integer 
  value from the file, and put that value in a global variable. Thread #1
  will then wait for thread #2 before moving on to the next value (in 
  hw4-1.in).

* THREAD #2 will open a file (hw4-2.in) for reading, will read 1 integer
  value from the file, will compare the value it read (from hw4-2.in) and the
  value read by thread #1 (from hw4-1.in), and write the 2 integers (side by 
  side) to hw4.out such that the smaller value is on the left (see example 
  below). Thread #2 will then generate a signal telling both threads to move 
  on to the next values in their respective files. Here is an example of what
  hw4.out should look like:
   3 5
   6 8
   1 5

  When all of the data has been read, return control to the MAIN routine.


* Note that both *.in files with have the same number of values.

Requirements:
-------------
1. The *.in files will have the format of "integer" "linefeed". If you do not 
abide by the input format and my program cannot test your program will my inputs
it will be considered wrong. No exceptions! Thus, I suggest you use the command
"fscanf(file, "%d\n", &value1)" to read your *.in files. For example:
11
12
31
43
55

2. Hw4.out must have the exact format of "integer" "1 space" "integer" "linefeed" 
as the *.in files will be very long and I will have a program that runs through 
your output files checking results. If you do not abide by the output format and
my program cannot test your output it will be considered wrong. No exceptions! 
Thus, I suggest you use the command "fprintf(file, "%d %d\n", value1, value2)" 
to write your hw4.out file. For example:
4 7
4 98
32 7
24 0

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 109/115.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw3-yourname.c or hw3-yourname.cpp

3. Email your source (subject hw3-yourname) to <<Redacted>>
