HW-1	CS451	10 points	Due: Friday, Sept. 6, midnight

The intent of this assignment is to write a little program 
that can extract text from a web page (just like the spiders do 
that spammers use to get email addresses).

Part 1:
Write a program that uses the system call "system" to
execute the command WGET. WGET must download ten webpages (of your
choice). Your program must display on the screen each webpage it
is currently processing.

* Note that WGET MUST operate in quite mode to get full credit!

Part 2:
Add to the program a section that loads and parses the downloaded
file extracting all instances of the word "Syria". Your program must
generate a listing on the screen of the extracted text.

Part 3:
Add to the program a section that removes the downloaded file using
UNLINK.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 109/115.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw1-yourname.c or hw1-yourname.cpp

3. Email your source (subject hw1-yourname) to <<Redacted>>
