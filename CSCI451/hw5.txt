HW-5	CS451	40 points	Due: Friday, October 18

It's that spooky time of year when the dead walk the Earth, 
things go bump in the night, and the Centers for Disease 
Control (CDC) recognizes the need for zombie preparedness 
(http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm). See also 
http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/_media/cymkPrint/11_225700_A_Zombie_Final.pdf 

This year it is even more spooky as the government shutdown 
has closed the CDC, so no anti-zombie shots this year. Expect
zombies to be running amok at a town near you!

To add insult to injury, the federal goverment risks going 
into default on Oct. 17 if Congress cannot agree to an increase 
of the U.S. debt ceiling.

To honor those corrupt morons in Congress, we will call this
assignment the 5 little corrupt Senators (Rob Andrews (D-NJ),
Michele Bachmann (R-MN), Tim Bishop (D-NY), Paul Broun (R-GA), 
and Vern Buchanan (R-FL)). see http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/mostcorrupt
We will honor Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) (another corrupt moron) 
by naming her the mommie thread 
(http://www.sodahead.com/united-states/dianne-feinstein-the-
most-corrupt-person-in-congress-routes-even-more-money-to-
husbands-firm/question-3651127/)

Since Congress cannot balance their budget, we will show them
how by writing a program that performs many parallel bank account
updates WITHOUT a lost update!

Write a C/C++ program that uses the PTHREAD library to create 5 
threads and mutexes to synchronize them. The program must to the 
following:

* Dianne may initialize the mutexes, then call the threads Rob, 
  Michele, Tim, Paul and Vern. You may want to detach the threads 
  (I wish we could in reality) once they are created. 

* Each thread will open its own command file (Rob.in, Michele.in, 
  etc) for reading. The file format will be:

   R
   +/-N
   +/-N	Note that there may be many +/-N lines
   W

   R indicates the start of a critical section - where you will acquire
     the account balance from global storage.

   +/-N indicates a deposit (+N) or withdraw (-N) from the account.

   W indicates the end of the critical section - where you will write 
     the accout balance to global storage. At this point each thread must
     also display the text:

   Account balance after thread *thread_name_here* is $xxx

NOTES:
------
Start with a budget of 0 (zero).

Each input file may be of different length and you may simply allow 
the thread to die at that point. Hence you may not want to have Dianne 
employ a pthread_join.

The result of the single account should NOT contain any lost update. 
That is, the results should be the same as if a single thread processed
all 5 input files on the single account (hint, for testing). However, you 
CANNOT force the threads into any serial execution. Once spawned they 
must be free from external influences.

I suggest you include a sleep() function in each thread to make sure 
each thread runs long enough to get the random update behavior required.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 109/115.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw5-yourname.c or hw5-yourname.cpp

3. Email your source (subject hw5-yourname) to <<Redacted>>
