HW-2	CS451	10 points	Due: Sept. 13, 2013

Write a program emulating a scheduler. Your program 
must Fork() & Exe() [1] several programs, one at a 
time, in order, and it must kill/suspend the previous 
running program before starting the next (ie only 1 
program can be running at a time). It helps to have 
"X" programs so you can watch what happens [2]. Thus, 
the programs required are xclock, xeyes, and  xlogo. 
The program must run until stopped (cntrl C) by the user.

[1] See UNIX System Calls link on class webpage for 
samples.

[2] Make sure you include 1 second delay loops. It 
gives the processes enough time to load/start and enough 
time for you to make sure things work correctly.

NOTES:  

1. You will need to know where these "X" programs are.
One command useful for this is "find".


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 109/115.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw2-yourname.c or hw2-yourname.cpp

3. Email your source (subject hw2-yourname) to <<Redacted>>
