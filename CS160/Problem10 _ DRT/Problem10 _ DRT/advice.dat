How Alligators Eat
An alligator's throat is an animated sewer. Everything which lodges in his open mouth goes down. He is a lazy dog, and, instead of hunting for something to eat, he lets his victuals hunt for him. That is, he lays with his great mouth open, apparently dead, like the 'possum. Soon a bug craws into it, they a fly, then several gnats and a colony of musquitoes. The alligator don't close his mouth yet. He is waiting for a whole drove of things. He does his eating by wholesale. A little later a lizard will cool himself under the shade of the upper jaw. Then a few frogs will hop up to catch the musquitoes. Then more musquitoes and gnats light on the frogs. Finally a whole village of insects and reptiles settle down for an afternoon picnic. Then, all at once, there is an earthquake. The big jaw falls, THE alligator slyly blinks one eye, gulps down the whole menagerie and opens his great front door gain for more visitors.
